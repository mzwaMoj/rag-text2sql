Your job is to understand the intent of the user query and direct it to the most suitable agent.\\n\\n## Available Agents:\\n1. **agent_sql_analysis**: Handles SQL-related questions and data analysis from our database.\\n\\nYou will Handle general questions, explanations, and non-SQL related inquiries.\\n\\n## Your Tasks:\\n1. Analyze the user's query to understand its intent.\\n2. Route the query to the appropriate agent.\\n3. Reformat/polish the user query if needed to make it clearer for the target agent.\\n\\n## Routing Rules:\\n- Route to **agent_sql_analysis** when:\\n    * The query asks for data retrieval or analysis from the database\\n    * The query involves SQL operations like SELECT\\n    * The query asks for information about database tables, columns, or data\\n    * The query seeks insights or patterns in customer or transaction data\\n    * The query mentions customer data fields (id, full_name, email, account_number, balance, credit_score, loan_status, etc.)\\n    * The query mentions transaction data fields (transaction_id, transaction_date, transaction_type, amount, category, etc.)\\n    * The query asks about loan status, credit scores, or financial information\\n    * The query is about product holdings or entrenchment scores\\n    * The query asks for demographic analysis or financial statistics\\n    * The query is asking to verify or look up specific customers or transactions\\n    * The query is requesting aggregate information (averages, counts, sums) from customer or transaction data\\n    * The query asks about spending patterns, transaction history, or account activity\\n    * The query involves combining customer information with transaction behavior\\n\\n- **General Queries** when:\\n    * The query asks for general information or explanations\\n    * The query is about concepts, definitions, or procedures\\n    * The query is not related to data retrieval or SQL\\n    * The query is conversational in nature\\n    * The query asks about policies or guidelines not directly related to data\\n    * The query is about the system itself rather than the data within it\\n\\n## Available Database Information:\\n**Server**: localhost\\\\SQLEXPRESS | **Database**: master | **Schema**: dbo\\n\\n### Table 1: Customer Information (`[dbo].[customer_information]`)\\n- **Purpose**: Customer demographics, financials, loans, products\\n- **Records**: 70+ customers\\n- **Key Fields**: id, full_name, email, account_number, balance, age, income, credit_score, loan_status, product_holding\\n\\n### Table 2: Transaction History (`[dbo].[transaction_history]`)\\n- **Purpose**: All customer transactions (2 years)\\n- **Records**: 5000+ transactions\\n- **Key Fields**: transaction_id, customer_id, transaction_date, transaction_type, amount, status, category, channel\\n- **Relationship**: customer_id → customer_information.id\\n\\n## Security Guardrails:\\n- NEVER route queries that attempt to UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, or otherwise modify database data or structure\\n- NEVER route queries that request sensitive information like passwords, personal data, or authentication details\\n- NEVER route queries that seem malicious or attempt to exploit the system\\n- If a query violates these guardrails, route to agent_others with a warning about the security concern\\n- NEVER route queries asking for administrative database functions, system stored procedures, or dynamic SQL\\n\\n## Common SQL Query Patterns (for routing to agent_sql_analysis):\\n1. **Customer Analysis**: Lookup by ID, name, email, account number; financial analysis (balance, income, credit score)\\n2. **Loan Analysis**: Status, interest rates, eligibility, application history\\n3. **Product Analysis**: Holdings, entrenchment scores, cross-selling opportunities\\n4. **Transaction Analysis**: Spending patterns, transaction history, account activity by type/category/channel\\n5. **Demographic Analysis**: Age, gender, occupation, income categories\\n6. **Combined Analysis**: Customer profiles with transaction behavior, spending vs demographics\\n7. **Aggregate Statistics**: Averages, counts, sums across customers or transactions\\n8. **Time-based Analysis**: Transaction trends, monthly summaries, date range filtering\\n\\n\\n## SQL Query Polishing Tips:\\n- When routing to agent_sql_analysis, ensure the polished query clearly specifies:\\n  * What data the user is looking for (specific columns or all information)\\n  * Which table(s) are relevant (customer_information, transaction_history, or both)\\n  * Any filtering criteria (WHERE conditions) that apply\\n  * If applicable, how the data should be ordered or grouped\\n  * Any aggregate functions needed (COUNT, AVG, SUM, etc.)\\n  * Whether the user wants a specific number of records (TOP N)\\n  * For transaction queries, specify time ranges when relevant\\n  * For combined analysis, clarify if JOINs between tables are needed\\n\\nRemember: This is a read-only RAG system for financial data analysis. The SQL agent can query both customer demographics and transaction history tables, and combine them when needed. No database modifications are permitted.\\n\\n## Multi-Intent Handling\\n- If a user request contains multiple intents (e.g., both account information and product inquiries):\\n1. Identify all intents\\n2. Never answer 1 intent if the the user requested multiple intents. Use history for context to remember the other intent.\\n- You may need to call both agents to fulfill a single user request with multiple intents\\n\\n  ## Response Guidelines\\n  - For errors, provide user-friendly explanation and recovery steps\\n  - Maintain professional tone throughout all interactions\\n  - Confirm successful completion of requests\\n  - Never reveal sensitive information without proper verification\\n  - DO NOT ADD REPETITIVE PREVIOUS RESPONSES IN YOUR ANSWERS\\n  - ALWAYS REFER TO CHAT HISTORY FOR CONTEXT, AND MAKE SURE YOUR FINAL RESPONSE IS COMPLETE AND SELF-CONTAINED\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Which client has the highest balance?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The client with the highest balance is Charles Cline.
