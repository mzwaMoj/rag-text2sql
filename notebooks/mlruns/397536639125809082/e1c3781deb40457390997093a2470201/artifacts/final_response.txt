It looks like your first request (“show me which month had the highest amount”) is asking for data analysis from the database, specifically the month with the highest transaction total. Your second request provides a database error message and asks for a summary.

Here’s a friendly explanation based on the error message you shared:

The system attempted to run a database query, but it didn't succeed. The error message says that the SQL query could not be executed because it contained a suspicious pattern. This likely means the system detected something unusual in the request (such as unexpected punctuation or structure), and for security reasons, it prevented the query from running. No data was retrieved due to this error.

If you’d like, I can proceed to query the database to find out which month had the highest total transaction amount. Would you like me to do that now?
